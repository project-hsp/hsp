# Building on HSP — Developer Guide

A self-contained introduction for hackathon developers. It explains what HSP is,
what you can build, the tools you get, and how to send your first payment.

> You do **not** need to run any infrastructure. The organizer hosts a shared
> sandbox; you point the SDK at it and pay. Everywhere you see `<...>` below, the
> organizer will give you the value (Coordinator URL, API key, faucet). **These
> values — and the SDK repository link — are shared once the sandbox has been
> deployed, typically a few days later. Until then, use this guide to plan.**

## 1. What is HSP?

**HSP** is a verifiable settlement layer for
stablecoin payments. Instead of trusting a payment processor's "paid" flag, every
payment carries cryptographic evidence that **anyone** can re-check.

The flow is always the same three moves:

1. **Intent** — the payer signs a *mandate* (an EIP-712 message: pay *this much* of
   *this token* to *this recipient* on *this chain*, meeting *these requirements*).
2. **Settlement** — the payer's **own wallet** broadcasts the on-chain transfer.
   HSP is **zero-custody**: no service ever holds your funds.
3. **Verification** — a *verifier* independently checks the receipt against the
   mandate and a pinned trust policy. **ACCEPT means ship.**

Three wire objects carry the evidence:

| Object | Signed by | Says |
|---|---|---|
| **Mandate** | the payer | "I intend to pay X to Y, and I require capabilities Z" |
| **Receipt** | an adapter | "I observed the settlement that satisfies this mandate" |
| **Attestation** | an issuer | "I vouch that the subject is KYC'd / not sanctioned / …" |

**The one rule that decides everything:** a verifier ACCEPTs a payment **iff**

```
requiredCapabilities  ⊆  satisfiedCapabilities
```

— i.e. everything the payer's mandate *required* is *satisfied* by the receipt's
proof and the attestations. Nothing else. That single subset check is the whole
trust model.

## 2. What you can build (this release)

Four payment scenarios are supported end-to-end:

| # | Scenario | What it demonstrates |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Public payment** (evm-transfer) | a plain ERC-20 stablecoin transfer, verified |
| 2 | **Public payment** (x402) | paying via real **Coinbase x402 v2** (HTTP-native) |
| 3 | **Compliant payment** (evm-transfer) | a transfer that also carries **KYC + sanctions** attestations |
| 4 | **Compliant payment** (x402) | KYC/sanctions over the x402 path |

Build agentic commerce, paid APIs (x402 paywalls), compliant settlement flows, or
your own settlement adapter (see §7).

---

## 3. The tool stack

You consume HSP through a small layered stack — pick the layer that fits:

```
  skills/hsp-verify — an AI skill: an agent verifies & reasons about HSP payments (no money)
  @hsp/mcp          — MCP server (pure/key-less): agents verify / explain / build HSP objects
  @hsp/sdk          — one-call pay() + independent verify()        ← most developers start here
  @hsp/devkit       — build + conformance-test your own adapter
  @hsp/core         — protocol primitives (types, capabilities, verifier, signer)
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Coordinator       — the hosted hub (you point your SDK at it)
```

The **Coordinator** is the only service you talk to over the network. It registers
mandates, observes your on-chain settlement, runs the verifier, stores the
`(mandate, receipt, attestations)` triple, and serves status + a web **Explorer**
and **developer portal**. It is custody-free — it signs *observations*, never moves
money.

---

## 4. Quickstart — your first payment in 5 minutes

### What the organizer gives you

- `<COORDINATOR_URL>` — the shared sandbox Coordinator (e.g. `https://…`)
- `<API_KEY>` — your team's write key (or get your own at `<COORDINATOR_URL>/register`, self-service — no need to wait for the organizer)
- `<CHAIN>` — the chain name, e.g. `hashkey-testnet`
- A **faucet** to get testnet gas + USDC for your address

### Install

The SDK is distributed as a repository for the hackathon (not yet on npm). The
organizer shares the repository link together with the sandbox details:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/project-hsp/hsp && cd hsp
# everything runs in Docker (no node needed on your host) — see the repo README,
# or use your own Node 20+ toolchain:
npm install
```

### Get testnet funds

```sh
curl -X POST <FAUCET_URL>/faucet -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"address":"0xYOUR_ADDRESS"}'
```

### Send a payment

```ts
import { HSPClient } from '@hsp/sdk';
import { resolveChain } from '@hsp/core/chains/index';

const chain = resolveChain('hashkey-testnet');               // pinned testnet USDC

const hsp = new HSPClient({
  coordinatorUrl: process.env.HSP_COORDINATOR_URL!,          // <COORDINATOR_URL>
  apiKey:         process.env.HSP_API_KEY!,                  // <API_KEY>
  signer:         { kind: 'privateKey', privateKey: process.env.HSP_PRIVATE_KEY as `0x${string}` },
  chain,
});

// USDC has 6 decimals → 1 USDC = 1_000_000 base units
const handle = await hsp.pay({ to: '0xRecipientAddress', amount: 1_000_000n });

console.log(handle.paymentId, handle.txHash, handle.status); // mandateHash, on-chain tx, status
const final = await handle.awaitSettled();                   // polls to SETTLED
console.log(final.status);                                   // "SETTLED"
```

That single `pay()` call: builds the mandate → signs it → registers it with the
Coordinator → broadcasts the ERC-20 transfer **from your own wallet** → asks the
Coordinator to observe it → returns a handle. Open `<COORDINATOR_URL>/explorer` to
watch the decision trace.

---

## 5. Core concepts you'll meet

**Capabilities** — typed requirements, written `verb:object:version`. The verbs:

- `proves:…` — the settlement structurally proves something (e.g. `proves:settlement-verified`)
- `attests:…` — an issuer vouches for something (e.g. `attests:kyc`, `attests:sanctions`)

A *public* payment requires the empty set (trivially satisfied). A *compliant*
payment requires `attests:kyc` + `attests:sanctions`, satisfied by attestations.

**The verifier** — pure function of `(mandate, receipt, attestations, policy)`.
ACCEPT iff `requiredCapabilities ⊆ satisfiedCapabilities`. You can run it yourself
(see §6) — you never have to trust the Coordinator's word.

**Signer** — three backends, same wire signature:

- `{ kind: 'privateKey', privateKey }` — demo / scripts (small amounts)
- `{ kind: 'viemAccount', account }` — any viem local account
- `{ kind: 'eip1193', provider, address }` — browser / wallet (key never leaves the wallet)

The signing account is also the settling account (wallet-settling: `Transfer.from`
must equal the mandate signer).

**paymentId** — equals the `mandateHash`. Use it to query status.

---

## 6. Recipes

### Compliant payment (KYC + sanctions)

```ts
const hsp = new HSPClient({ /* …as above… */, issuerUrl: process.env.HSP_ISSUER_URL });

await hsp.pay({
  to: '0xRecipient',
  amount: 1_000_000n,
  profile: { compliance: ['kyc', 'sanctions'] },   // → fetches attestations, signs the caps in
});
```

The SDK fetches the matching attestations from the issuer and registers them with
the Coordinator alongside your mandate; the verifier credits them.

### Pay via x402 (real Coinbase x402 v2)

```ts
await hsp.payX402({
  merchant:       '0xMerchant',
  facilitatorUrl: process.env.HSP_FACILITATOR_URL!,   // <FACILITATOR_URL>
  amount:         1_000_000n,
  // profile: { compliance: ['kyc', 'sanctions'] },   // optional: compliant x402
});
```

You sign both an HSP mandate and an EIP-3009 authorization; a stock facilitator settles
on-chain (you pay no gas), then the Coordinator confirms the transfer and signs the
verifiable HSP receipt.

To **charge** for an HTTP resource (an x402 paywall), use the SDK's `x402Gate` /
`fetchWithX402` helpers — see `docs/guide.md`.

### Verify a payment you received (don't trust the Coordinator)

```ts
import { HSPVerifier } from '@hsp/sdk';

const verifier = new HSPVerifier({
  chain,
  adapterAddress: '0x<pinned-adapter-address>',   // pin once from GET <COORDINATOR_URL>/chains
  // compliance: { trustedIssuers: […], policyRequiredCaps: […] },   // for compliant payments
});

const decision = await verifier.verify(mandate, receipt, attestations);
if (decision.ok && decision.outcomeClass === 'ACCEPT') {
  shipTheGoods();   // ACCEPT means ship
}
```

You pin the adapter's observation address **out-of-band** (from `/chains` at setup,
or your own records) and verify locally — the proof is yours to check.

---

## 7. Build your own settlement adapter

Want to settle a different way (a new rail, a new proof)? `@hsp/devkit` gives you a
template plus a conformance runner that checks your adapter against the protocol's
generic obligations using the **real** verifier:

```sh
# 1. copy packages/devkit/template/my-adapter.ts and fill in your proof + verify()
# 2. run the conformance suite until everything passes
npm run template -w @hsp/devkit
# 3. submit (adapterId, instanceKey, signing address, reorgPolicy) to the organizer
#    to be registered in the sandbox Coordinator's trust set
```

---

## 8. AI agents

Two pieces help an AI agent work with HSP:

- **`@hsp/mcp`** — a **pure, key-less** MCP server. It holds no private key and moves
  no money; it gives an agent eight tools to *reason over* HSP — `hsp_verify` (run the
  verifier), `hsp_explain` (the decision narrated), `hsp_inspect` (decode a
  mandate/receipt/attestation), `hsp_capability` + `hsp_capability_diff` (the policy
  language), `hsp_build_requirements` + `hsp_check_requirements` (what a payee demands),
  and `hsp_build_mandate` (an unsigned mandate + its hash). **To actually pay, the agent
  uses `@hsp/sdk` (`HSPClient.pay` / `payX402`)** — the MCP signs nothing.
- **`skills/hsp-verify`** — an AI skill that teaches an agent to *verify & reason about*
  HSP payments: verify / explain a received payment, inspect/decode wire objects, resolve
  capabilities, and check requirements. It moves no money and holds no key. **To actually
  pay, use `@hsp/sdk`.**

The MCP needs only `HSP_CHAIN`; optionally pin the adapter address
(`HSP_PINNED_ADAPTER_ADDRESS`) so `hsp_verify` can check receipts. The
`.mcp.json.example` in the repo shows the registration.

## 9. Coordinator endpoints you'll use

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/payments` | register a signed mandate (+ attestations) |
| `POST` | `/payments/:id/observe` | ask the Coordinator to observe your settlement tx |
| `GET`  | `/payments/:id` | payment status + the stored triple |
| `GET`  | `/payments/:id/explain` | label-resolved decision trace (what the Explorer shows) |
| `GET`  | `/requirements?chain=` | the deployment's requirement advertisement |
| `GET`  | `/chains` | chain registry + the adapter address to pin |
| `GET`  | `/stats` | public aggregate dashboard |
| `GET`  | `/docs`, `/explorer` | developer portal + decision-trace UI |

Write endpoints need `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`.

---

## 10. Outcomes & error handling

Every verifier decision carries an `outcomeClass` — branch on it like an HTTP status:

| outcomeClass | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `ACCEPT` | verified | ship |
| `RETRYABLE` | transient (e.g. not yet observable) | retry |
| `POLICY` | a policy/requirement isn't met | fix the mandate/attestations |
| `PERMANENT` | structurally invalid | give up / debug |

`pay()` waits for the tx to mine before observing; `observe` answers `202` while the
tx is still confirming — the SDK retries for you.

---

## 11. Trust model in one paragraph

HSP is **zero-custody**: your wallet settles; the Coordinator only signs
*observations* with an adapter key (it cannot move funds). A relying party (a
merchant, an auditor, a platform) **pins** the adapter's address once and runs the
verifier itself — *ACCEPT means ship* never requires trusting the Coordinator's
answer. Keys: use a small demo key for scripts; use `eip1193` (a real wallet) for
anything that matters — the key stays in the wallet.

---

## 12. What you'll get from the organizer

> Shared once the sandbox has been deployed — typically a few days later.

- `https://github.com/project-hsp/hsp` — the SDK repository (already public)
- `<COORDINATOR_URL>` — the hosted sandbox Coordinator
- `<API_KEY>` — your per-team write key (or self-service: get your own at `<COORDINATOR_URL>/register`)
- `<CHAIN>` — chain name (e.g. `hashkey-testnet`) + the pinned stablecoin
- `<FAUCET_URL>` — testnet gas + USDC
- `<FACILITATOR_URL>` — *(optional)* for the x402 scenarios
- The adapter address to pin for independent verification (also at `/chains`)

---

*HSP is pre-1.0 — the wire format may change between releases.*
